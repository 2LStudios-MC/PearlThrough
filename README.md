# PearlThrough
Made due to multiple requests
Code might not be the best, still learning Java.

# Notes
* Pearling through slabs and stairs have been completely disabled, you could possibly change it inside of rip/skyland/pearls/entity/CustomEnderpearl if you can code.
* This requires a spigot using 1.7.4 NMS, I could probably change it to any spigot on request.
* i have no fucking clue how git works, please dont judge me ;(
