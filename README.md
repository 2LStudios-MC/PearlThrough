# PearlThrough
Made due to multiple requests.
Code might not be the best, still learning Java.

I only made this to prove the point that it's very easy to make a pearl through a plugin instead of a spigot without any issues.


# Installation
To compile the plugin we use maven

1. If you don't have maven installed yet, install it.
2. execute ``mvn clean install`` inside of the root folder.

# Notes
* This requires a spigot using 1.7.4 NMS, I could probably change it to any spigot on request.
* I recommend to disable antiglitch while using taliban pearls.
* I don't know what talibans do, someone just told me that it allows you through slabs and stairs.
